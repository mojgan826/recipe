Let's begin!

Here is how you can make a Pancake:

1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract until well blended.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and slowly mix until combined.
4. Heat a griddle over medium heat. Add a small amount of butter or oil to coat the pan.
5. Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for each pancake. 
6. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes.
7. Done! Enjoy your pancake.
